# AzureStor-for-Machine-Learning-Services
R scripts that use the AzureStor package, invoked via SQL Server's Machine Learning Services.

<b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Azure/AzureStor">AzureStor</a> package for R (and possibly others) will need to be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.davemason.me/2022/11/04/rstudio-and-package-installation-for-machine-learning-services">installed</a> on the R version/instance for SQL Server.</li>
<li>Scripts were developed for use with an Azure Data Lake (ADLSgen2) storage endpoint, but should be compatible with Blob storage and File storage endpoints too.</li>
</ul>
